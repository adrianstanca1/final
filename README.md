# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1bxBJgk2nuKF5tvtdT-YfJQL4PdtvzUvq

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Environment variables

The app reads its Gemini credentials from the standard Vite prefix so that the
key is available in the browser bundle. When developing locally create a
`.env.local` file from the provided example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` and set the `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`. The same variable must
be configured in any deployment environment.

## Deploying to Vercel

This project is ready to be deployed as a static Vite site on Vercel.

1. Create a new Vercel project and select this repository.
2. In the **Environment Variables** section add `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your
   Gemini API key (repeat for Preview/Production as needed).
3. Vercel automatically detects the framework and runs `npm install` followed by
   `npm run build`. The generated `dist` directory is served as static assets.
4. The included `vercel.json` ensures single-page application routing works, so
   deep links render correctly without additional configuration.

After the first build completes, visit the generated Vercel URL to confirm the
application loads and AI powered features work with your configured API key.

2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. (Optional) Point authentication at a deployed backend by setting `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.local`. When omitted the app runs in secure local demo mode and persists accounts in browser storage.
4. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

### Configure authentication backend

By default the registration and login flows use the encrypted in-browser mock API. Provide a `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.local` to connect to a real authentication service. If that service becomes unreachable you can allow automatic fallback to the mock implementation by exposing `window.__ASAGENTS_API_BASE_URL__` at runtime or by calling `configureAuthClient({ baseUrl, allowMockFallback: true })` in your initialization code.

## Deployment automation

This project ships with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline backed by GitHub Actions and Vercel.

- Pull requests run tests and builds via the [`CI` workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
- Previews and production releases are handled by the [`Deploy to Vercel` workflow](.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml). Pushes to `main` promote the build to the production environment; pull requests publish preview URLs for QA.
- The legacy GitHub Pages workflow remains available in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) for static exports if you need an alternative host.

### Operations playbooks & secrets

- **Runbooks & responsibilities**: [docs/deployment-plan.md](docs/deployment-plan.md) outlines the automation flow, operational checklists, and ownership model for engineers, reviewers, QA, and on-call.
- **Vercel-specific setup**: follow [docs/vercel-deployment.md](docs/vercel-deployment.md) to connect the repository to Vercel and provision the required secrets (`VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`).
- **Gemini credentials**: store the shared Gemini credential as `GEMINI_API_KEY` in repository secrets and mirror it to `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` (or provide a separate client-safe key). Developers keep personal keys in `.env.local` for local runs.
- **Monitoring**: follow the plan's observability section to wire synthetic uptime checks and error tracking so deployments stay production ready.
