├── ai.ts            # AI integration endpoints
├── upload.ts        # File upload handling
└── analytics.ts     # Reporting and analytics
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Estimated: 6-8 hours)  
```bash
# 2. Replace mock API with real backend calls
src/services/
├── api.ts           # Replace mockApi.ts with real HTTP client
├── auth.ts          # Update to use JWT authentication
├── websocket.ts     # Add Socket.IO integration
└── offline.ts       # Update offline queue for backend
```

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Estimated: 2-4 hours)
```bash
# 3. Deploy to cloud infrastructure
scripts/
├── deploy-aws.sh    # AWS deployment script
├── deploy-gcp.sh    # Google Cloud deployment script  
└── deploy-azure.sh  # Azure deployment script
```

### Phase 4: Performance & Security (Estimated: 3-5 hours)
```bash
# 4. Production optimizations
- Database indexing and query optimization
- Redis caching strategy implementation
- Security hardening and penetration testing
- Load testing and performance monitoring
```

## 🚀 Immediate Development Commands

### 1. Start Full Development Environment
```bash
# Start all services with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Check services are running
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

### 2. Develop Backend API Routes
```bash
cd backend

# Start development with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Check API documentation
open http://localhost:3001/api/docs
```

### 3. Integrate Frontend
```bash
# Start frontend development server  
npm run dev

# Update API base URL to backend
# Edit .env.local: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### 4. Test Integration
```bash
# Test authentication flow
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@company.com","password":"password"}'

# Test project creation (with auth token)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

export const authService = {
  async login(credentials) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(credentials)
    });
    const { access_token, refresh_token } = await response.json();
    // Store tokens and update auth context
  }
};
```

### 2. Real-time Features
```typescript
// Socket.IO integration for live updates
const socket = io('http://localhost:3001');
socket.on('project_updated', (project) => {
  // Update frontend state
});
```

### 3. Offline Sync
```typescript
// Queue operations when offline, sync when online
export const offlineQueue = {
  async syncPendingOperations() {
    const pending = await getQueuedOperations();
    for (const operation of pending) {
      await retryOperation(operation);
    }
  }
};
```
