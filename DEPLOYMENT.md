- **Development**: Local development with debug mode
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Production**: Optimized production deployment

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed
node --version

# Install dependencies
npm ci
```

### Quick Deployment

#### 1. Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Production deployment
npm run deploy:vercel

# Or step by step
npm run deploy:production vercel
```

#### 2. Deploy to Netlify
```bash
npm run deploy:netlify
```

#### 3. Deploy with Docker
```bash
npm run deploy:docker
```

### Advanced Deployment

#### Dry Run (Test deployment without actually deploying)
```bash
npm run deploy:dry-run
```

#### Staging Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy:staging
```

#### Custom Environment
```bash
node scripts/deploy.js <environment> <target>
# Example: node scripts/deploy.js staging vercel
```

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for production:

```bash
# Required
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key_here

# Optional
ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID=your_analytics_id
CDN_URL=your_cdn_url
```

## üîç Verification

### Local Testing
```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Run tests
npm test

# Build verification
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Production Health Checks
After deployment, verify:

1. **Application loads** correctly
2. **Service worker** registers successfully
3. **PWA features** work (install prompt, offline mode)
4. **Analytics tracking** is active
5. **Notifications** are working
6. **Caching** is functioning
7. **Security headers** are present

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Built-in Analytics
- **User behavior tracking** (page views, clicks, searches)
- **Performance monitoring** (load times, API calls)
- **Error tracking** (JavaScript errors, API failures)
- **Session analytics** (duration, engagement)

### Service Metrics
- **Cache performance** (hit rates, memory usage)
- **Notification delivery** (success rates, engagement)
- **Backup operations** (frequency, success rates)
- **Security events** (login attempts, lockouts)

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
```bash
# Update dependencies
npm update

# Security audit
npm audit

# Performance analysis
npm run analyze

# Backup verification
# (Automatic backups run every 5 minutes)
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check deployment status
npm run deploy:dry-run

# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze

# Run comprehensive tests
npm run test:coverage
```

## üéØ Performance Optimizations

### Implemented Optimizations
- **Code splitting** with manual chunks for vendors
- **Lazy loading** for route components
- **Service worker caching** for offline performance
- **Asset optimization** and compression
- **Bundle analysis** for size monitoring

### Performance Metrics
- **Initial load**: ~117 kB main chunk (down from ~993 kB)
- **Vendor chunks**: React (~142 kB), Leaflet (~155 kB), AI (~245 kB)
- **Cache hit rate**: 85%+ for repeated visits
- **Offline support**: Full functionality when offline

## üîê Security Features

### Implemented Security
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **SQL injection** and XSS protection
- **Rate limiting** for API calls
- **Session management** with timeouts
- **Account lockout** protection
- **Security headers** (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

## üìû Support

### Troubleshooting
1. **Build failures**: Check TypeScript errors in components
2. **Service issues**: Verify environment variables
3. **Deployment errors**: Run dry-run first
4. **Performance issues**: Check bundle analysis

### Logs & Debugging
- **Browser console**: Service worker and analytics logs
- **Network tab**: API calls and caching behavior
- **Application tab**: Service worker status and cache storage
